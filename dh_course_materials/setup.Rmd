## Setup

This notebook installs all of the packaged needed for the other notebooks. If
you are running this using the workspaces on RStudio Cloud, you should not need
to re-run this. On your own machine, this is needed before proceeding through
the other notebooks. See Notebook01 for information about how to run R code and
how code is structure into packages.

```{r}
install.packages(
  pkgs = c(
    "tidyverse", "ggrepel", "cleanNLP", "ggimg", "jsonlite", "keras",
    "lubridate", "readxl", "rnaturalearth", "sf", "stringi", "xml2",
    "readr", "ggplot2", "stringi", "forcats", "ggrepel", "tidyr",
    "tidyverse", "Hmisc", "irlba", "devtools", "umap", "glmnet",
    "remotes", "tidyverse", "knitr", "rmarkdown", "igraph"
  )
)
```

Once you install the packages above, also install the following directly from
GitHub.

```{r}
remotes::install_github("statsmaths/smodels", upgrade = "never")
```
